=============

ROS interface to the Visual-inertial sensor developed by the [Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL), ETH Zurich](http://www.asl.ethz.ch) and [Skybotix AG](http://www.skybotix.com). This sensor provides fully time-synchronized and factory calibrated IMU- and stereo-camera datastreams. A detailed spec sheet can be found [here](http://www.skybotix.com/skybotix-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VISensor_Factsheet_web.pdf). 

A detailed description on how the sensor can be used in ROS is found in the corresponding [ROS-Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/vi_sensor).
